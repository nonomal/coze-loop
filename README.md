## What is Coze Loop

[Coze Loop](https://www.coze.cn/loop) is a developer-oriented, platform-level solution focused on the development and operation of AI agents. It addresses various challenges faced during the AI agent development process, providing full lifecycle management capabilities from development, debugging, evaluation, to monitoring.

Based on the commercial version, Coze Loop introduces an open-source edition that offers developers free access to core foundational feature modules. By sharing its core technology framework in an open-source model, developers can customize and extend according to business needs, facilitating community co-construction, sharing, and exchange, helping developers participate in AI agent exploration and practice with zero barriers.

## What can Coze Loop do?
Coze Loop helps developers efficiently develop and operate AI agents by providing full-lifecycle management capabilities. Whether it's prompt engineering, AI agent evaluation, or monitoring and optimization after deployment, Coze Loop offers powerful tools and intelligent support, significantly simplifying the AI agent development process and improving the performance and stability of AI agents.

* **Prompt development**: Coze Loop's prompt development module provides developers with full-process support from writing, debugging, and optimization to version management. With a visual Playground, developers can conduct real-time interactive testing of prompts, enabling intuitive comparisons of the output effects of different LLMs.
* **Evaluation**: Coze Loop's evaluation module provides developers with systematic evaluation capabilities, enabling multi-dimensional automated testing of the output effects of prompts and Coze agents, such as accuracy, conciseness, and compliance.
* **Observation**: Coze Loop provides developers with visual observation capabilities for the full-chain execution process, fully recording each processing step from user input to AI output. This includes key nodes such as prompt parsing, model invocation, and tool execution, while automatically capturing intermediate results and abnormal states.

## Quick Start
> Refer to [Quick Start](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/2.-Quickstart) for detailed instructions on how to install and deploy the latest version of Coze Loop.

**Environment Requirements:**
* Install Docker and Docker Compose in advance, and start the Docker service.

**Operation Steps:**
1. Get the source code. Execute the following command to get the latest version of the Coze Loop source code.
   ```Bash
   # Clone the code
   git clone https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop.git
   # Enter the Coze Loop directory
   cd coze-loop
   ```
2. Configure the model. Go to the `conf/default/app/runtime/` directory, edit the `model_config.yaml` file, and modify the `api_key` and `model` fields. Taking Volcengine Ark as an example:
    * `api_key`: Volcengine Ark API Key. For how to obtain it, please refer to [Get API Key](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594).
    * `model`: The Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark model access point. For how to obtain it, please refer to [Get Endpoint](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522).
3. Start the service. Execute the following command to quickly deploy the Coze Loop open-source edition using Docker Compose.
   ```Bash
   # Start the service, default is development mode
   docker compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the Coze Loop open-source edition by visiting `http://localhost:8082` in your browser.

## Using Coze Loop Open-source Edition

* [Prompt development and debugging](https://loop.coze.cn/open/docs/cozeloop/create-prompt): Coze Loop provides a complete prompt development workflow.
* [Evaluation](https://loop.coze.cn/open/docs/cozeloop/evaluation-quick-start): Coze Loop's evaluation functionality offers standardized evaluation data management, automated assessment engines, and comprehensive experimental result statistics.
* [Trace reporting and querying](https://loop.coze.cn/open/docs/cozeloop/trace_integrate): Coze Loop supports automatic Trace reporting for prompt debugging conducted on the platform, enabling real-time tracking of each Trace data.
* [Open-source Edition usage of the Coze Loop SDK](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-loop/wiki/8.-Open-source-edition-uses-CozeLoop-SDK): The Coze Loop SDK in three languages is suitable for both commercial and open-source editions. For the Open-source Edition, developers only need to modify some parameter configurations during initialization.
